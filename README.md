# Customer Support Ticket Menagement - BPMN

# 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository contains a Business Process Modeling (BPMN) project focused on Customer Support Ticket Management.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in:<br>
    •	business process analysis<br>
    •	AS-IS and TO-BE process modeling    
    •	subprocess decomposition<br>
    •	KPI definition<br>
    •	process automation design<br>

The project was created using ADONIS:CE and is targeted at Junior Business Analyst / Process Analyst / IT BA roles.

# 2. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The project covers the full lifecycle of a customer support ticket:<br>
    •	ticket submission by customer<br>
    •	first-line analysis and resolution<br>
    •	escalation to second-line support<br>
    •	ticket investigation and resolution<br>
    •	status management<br>
    •	ticket closure<br>
    
Both current-state (AS-IS) and future-state (TO-BE) processes are included.

# 3. REPOSITORY CONTENTS
This repository contains three BPMN diagrams exported as PDF files:
1. AS-IS Process
Current state of the customer support ticket handling process.

2.	TO-BE Process
Improved future-state process with SLA monitoring, automation concepts and clearer responsibilities.

3.	TO-BE Subprocess – Investigate and Resolve Ticket
Detailed subprocess describing second-line investigation and resolution activities.

Each diagram is provided as a separate PDF for clarity and readability.

# 4. AS-IS PROCESS
The AS-IS process represents the existing support workflow and focuses on:<br>
    •	manual ticket handling<br>
    •	basic escalation logic<br>
    •	limited automation<br>
    •	minimal performance tracking<br>
    
The purpose of the AS-IS model is to identify improvement opportunities rather than optimize the process.

# 5. TO-BE PROCESS
The TO-BE process introduces a more structured, scalable and measurable workflow, including:<br>
    •	clearer separation of responsibilities<br>
    •	SLA monitoring and escalation logic<br>
    •	defined ticket statuses<br>
    •	customer confirmation before closure<br>
    •	subprocess decomposition<br>

This process reflects industry best practices aligned with ITIL-like service management models.

# 6. SUBPROCESS: INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE TICKET
This subprocess represents detailed second-line activities, including:<br>
    •	root cause analysis<br>
    •	solution identification<br>
    •	fix implementation<br>
    •	solution testing<br>
    •	ticket update and resolution<br>

The subprocess improves readability of the main TO-BE process and follows BPMN best practices for process decomposition.

# 7. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
The following KPIs were defined for the TO-BE process:

1. SLA Compliance Rate
Percentage of tickets resolved within the agreed SLA time.

2. Average Resolution Time
Average time from ticket submission to ticket resolution.

3. Escalation Rate
Percentage of tickets escalated from 1st line to 2nd line support.

4. Reopen Rate
Percentage of tickets reopened after being marked as resolved.

5. First Contact Resolution Rate
Percentage of tickets resolved by 1st line support without escalation.

These KPIs enable process performance monitoring and continuous improvement.

# 8. TO-BE AUTOMATION CONCEPTS 
The TO-BE model assumes the following automation capabilities:
1.	Automatic ticket registration after customer submission
2.	Automatic status updates (New, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
3.	Automatic SLA time tracking and SLA breach detection
4.	Automatic customer notifications after ticket resolution
5.	Automatic update of ticket history and audit trail

Automation elements are modeled conceptually to show future system capabilities, not technical implementation

# 9. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br>
Customer<br>
•	Submits support request<br>
•	Confirms whether the issue has been resolved<br>

1st Line Support<br>
•	Analyzes incoming tickets<br>
•	Resolves simple issues<br>
•	Communicates with the customer<br>
•	Decides whether escalation is required<br>

2nd Line Support<br>
•	Investigates complex issues<br>
•	Performs root cause analysis<br>
•	Implements and tests fixes<br>

System<br>
•	Registers tickets<br>
•	Updates ticket statuses<br>
•	Tracks SLA<br>
•	Maintains ticket data and history<br>

# 10. TOOLS USED<br>
•	ADONIS: CE – BPMN process modeling<br>
•	BPMN 2.0 notation<br>

# 11. PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
This project was created to:<br>
•	demonstrate understanding of BPMN modeling<br>
•	show ability to analyze and improve business processes<br>
•	present structured thinking and documentation skills<br>
•	support applications for Junior Business Analyst / Process Analyst roles<br>

# 12. NOTES<br>
•	The diagrams are intentionally separated into individual PDFs for clarity.<br>
•	The project focuses on process design and analysis rather than technical implementation.
